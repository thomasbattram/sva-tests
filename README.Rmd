# Assessing the best practice for surrogate variable analysis for epigenome-wide association studies

Including surrogate variables as covariates in EWAS is common practice, but there is no concensous on the best practice for creating these surrogate variables and many questions are unanswered. Here we assess the time taken to perform SVA and compare the SVs generated when altering these parameters:
1. SVA package (sva vs. smartsva)
2. Number of CpGs used 
3. Number of SVs

Time taken when altering number of samples is also tested.
